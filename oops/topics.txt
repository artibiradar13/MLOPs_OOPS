OOPS TOPICS------
1. Class and object
2.class has data/attribute and func/methods

3. why pyhton is called object oriented 
4. Advantages of oops:
  > you can create your own datatyppe
  > code reausability
  > debugging
  > easy to collab

5. end to end Project(CHAtbook class)
  > Encapsulation (__attribute)
  > getter and setter(They are methods to access (getter) and
                       modify (setter) private attributes safely, )
  > static method(A method that belongs to a class but doesn’t use instance or class variables.
                 It behaves like a regular function but lives inside the class namespace.)
    class Math:
    @staticmethod
    def add(x, y):
        return x + y

    print(Math.add(5, 3))  # 8

     m = Math()
    print(m.add(10, 20))   # 30

  > Inheritance
    >Inheritance allows a class (child/subclass) to inherit attributes
     and methods from another class (parent/superclass). 
     This helps reuse code and create a hierarchical relationship between classes.

  >Polymorphism
    Polymorphism means "many forms" — the same function or 
    method name can work in different ways depending on the object calling it.
